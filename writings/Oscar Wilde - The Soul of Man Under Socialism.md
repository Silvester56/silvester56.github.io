Wilde criticize charity by stating that it merely prolong the problem. The point is to reconstruct society so that poverty is impossible, which will result in individuals realizing their full potential, like Darwin or Rimbaut.
He adopts a libertarian kind of socialism.
Once socialism is realized, free time from work will make it possible for someone to follow their dreams and aspirations.
Charity is an insult to the poor, who have every reasons to be angry and in rebellion.
Oscar claims that working people cannot acquire "class consciousness" themselves :

>Misery and poverty are so absolutely degrading, and exercise such a paralyzing effect over the nature of men, that no class is ever really conscious of its own suffering. They have to be told of it by other people, and they often entirely disbelieve them.

Abolition of private property is advocated by Wilde from an individualist point of view :

>For the recognition of private property has really harmed Individualism, and obscured it, by confusing a man with what he possesses. It has led Individualism entirely astray. It has made gain not growth its aim. So that man thought that the important thing was to have, and did not know that the important thing is to be. The true perfection of man lies, not in what man has, but in what man is.

Wilde claims that Jesus was the first individualist, and that his message wasn't "rich = bad and poor = good" but rather :

>Ordinary riches can be stolen from a man. Real riches cannot. In the treasury-house of your soul, there are infinitely precious things, that may not be taken from you.

The author reject all authorities (despotism, oligarchy, democracy) and states that socialism will lead to individualism, and the abolition of government.
Criticism of punishment and of the mainstream approach to crime, claims that punishment increase crime tendencies. Common grounds with Malatesta regarding anti-social behaviors in socialism/anarchy : it will be treated as some kind of rare disease cured by kindness.

>But though a crime may not be against property, it may spring from the misery and rage and depression produced by our wrong system of property-holding, and so, when that system is abolished, will disappear.

Emphasis on automation in the next paragraph :

>All unintellectual labor, all monotonous, dull labor, all labor that deals with dreadful things, and involves unpleasant conditions, must be done by machinery.

Several paragraphs about art, the finest expression of individualism according to the author.
