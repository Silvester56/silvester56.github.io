Malatesta defines anarchy as the absence of government, and the state/government as the sum of political, legislative, military, juridical etc institutions. He claims that the confusion around the word (anarchy = chaos) is explained by the fact that people are born and live accustomed to the government, so they see it as natural/necessary.

>In the same way, someone whose legs had been bound from birth but had managed nevertheless to walk as best he could, might attribute his ability to move to those very bonds which in fact serve only to weaken and paralyse the muscular energy of his legs.[...]Just imagine if the doctor were to expound to our fictional man with the bound legs a theory, cleverly illustrated with a thousand invented cases to prove that if his legs were freed he would be unable to walk and would not live, then that man would ferociously defend his bonds and consider as his enemy anyone who tried to remove them.

Most people see gov/the state as the general "will of the people", an abstract political idea. For Malatesta, government is the will of the governors, who secures their own interests before the interests of all.

Brief history of the feudalism to capitalism transition. Malatesta distinguishes between political power (the state) and economical power (the capitalists), the former being the protector of the latter.
If human life was a constant conflict, then surely government will be a necessity for the "winners" to secure their interests/wealth over the "losers". But :

>[...] fortunately the future of mankind is a happier one because the law governing it is milder. This law is solidarity.

Malatesta claims that history showed that mutual aid is more effective than the struggle of all vs all.

>Solidarity, that is the harmony of interests and of feelings, the coming together of individuals for the wellbeing of all, and of all for the wellbeing of each, is the only environment in which Man can express his personality and achieve his optimum development and enjoy the greatest possible wellbeing. This is the goal towards which human evolution advances; it is the higher principle which resolves all existing antagonisms, that would otherwise be insoluble, and results in the freedom of each not being limited by, but complemented — indeed finding the necessary raison d’être in — the freedom of others.

Some have realized that they can achieve the goal of cooperation, but with domination (making other people work for them). But besides the long existence of domination, the spirit of solidarity still exist among oppressed people, where egoism and altruism are fused into one.

>The inhabitant of Naples is as concerned in the improvement to the living conditions of the people inhabiting the banks of the Ganges from whence cholera comes to him, as he is in the drainage of the fondaci of his own city.

The consequences of solidarity is the abolition of private property, and of its servant, the government.

Malatesta list a few objections, then claims that government cannot emerge if its function no longer exist, and that a new government without private property would recreate it.

>Organ and function are inseparable terms. Take away from an organ its function and either the organ dies or the function is re-established.

Even a socialist government would just be a waste of time/work/energy. The advances in society comes always from the masses themselves, and a good portion of daily life is organized by free association.

>If the people had the power to deal with the problems of production and food supplies, oh! have no fear that they might just die of hunger waiting for a government to make the necessary laws to deal with the problem.

The author differentiate between the governor and the administrator : the former is a privileged man and the latter is necessary for large scale projects, we can have a logistics worker which is not part of any government.

Once government and private property are abolished, then conflicts/war will no longer exist. Anarchists don't speak of "freedom" in idealistic terms, they will oppose wannabe rulers and anti-social behaviors which restricts the freedom of others. For Malatesta, the delinquent will be treated as an ill or unhappy person, without repression beyond what is necessary for self-defense.

>And statistics show that the number of crimes is hardly affected by repressive measures, whereas it changes dramatically with changes in economic conditions and in the attitudes of public opinion.
